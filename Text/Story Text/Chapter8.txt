[Right][LoadIsaac][FarRight][LoadLizzy][MidLeft][LoadBarrelle]
Is everyone[N]
comfortable?[AN]

[FarRight]
Mr. Barrelle, thank you very[N]
much for helping my client.[AN]
As an Etrurian Knight, please[N]
allows me to express my graditudes![AN]

[MidLeft][Beat][AN]

[FarRight]
Oh... sorry...[AN]
D-did I say something[N]
rude to you just now...?[AN]

[Right]
Sir Barrelle, she doesn't know[N]
how things are around here.[AN]
Please don't be upset with her.[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, I'm not upset...[AN]
Just confused,[N]
hearing that.[AN]

[FarRight]
...?[AN][Event]

[MidLeft]
Miss Knight, I'm afraid[N]
that on this island,[AN]
you shouldn't tell people[N]
you're an Etrurian Knight,[AN]
unless you're wanting[N]
to scare them off.[AN]

[FarRight]
Wh-what do you mean?[AN]
Why... are Etrurian[N]
Knights seen that way?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Seems you really don't know.[N]
Alright then, let me tell you.[AN]
The people of the Western Isles[N]
are oppressed by Etrurian lords.[AN]
If you put up any resistsance,[N]
you're arrested promptly.[AN]
So everyone is afraid of even[N]
the words "Etrurian knight."[AN]

[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
No, that can't be true![N]
Etrurians wouldn't do such things![AN]
The lords came to these islands[N]
to protect the people from bandits![AN]
It's... it's impossible that[N]
such things could happen![AN]

[MidLeft]
Now there's a joke. It's the[N]
complete opposite, young lady.[AN]
Not satisfied with just[N]
screwing us themselves,[AN]
the lords are more than eager to[N]
cooporate with the bandits too.[AN]
They gather up people and send[N]
them down to the death mines.[AN]

[FarRight]
Etrurians are a proud people![N]
They couldn't do such things![AN]
I think... I think need to[N]
go get some fresh air...[AN]
[Clear]

[Right][Clear][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
I understand how she feels.[AN]
I couldn't believe what[N]
horrors I saw here either.[AN]

[MidLeft]
The Isles are an Etrurian sanctuary.[AN]
They'll do unsavory things so long[N]
as it's behind their people's backs.[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Barrelle! We've got trouble![N]
He's having another seizure,[AN]
and we're losing control of[N]
the situation! Please help![AN]

[MidLeft]
Can you come help[N]
me with this?[AN]

[MidRight]
Of course.[A][X]




#0x93F Chapter8Opening2
[Left][LoadSelene][Right][LoadBarrelle][FarLeft][LoadElffin]
Agh...[N]
Argh...![AN]
Ugh...[AN]

[Left]
You can see how it's gotten...[N]
I can't deal with him on my own.[AN]
Could you two please restrain him?[AN]
I need to give him this medicine,[N]
but I can't while he's...[AN]
thrashing about like this.[AN]

[Right]
Got it. Isaac, you[N]
hold down his legs.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadIsaac]
Okay. Let's do it.[AN]

[Left]
Okay, open up...[N]
Just like that, okay?[A][X]

[Clear]

[Left]
Well, it seems the medicine worked.[AN]
Mister bard here should be sound asleep,[N]
at least for the next little while.[AN]

[FarRight]
Thank you for helping him.[N]
I wonder if this will be enough.[AN]

[Left]
I'm sorry, but[N]
I don't know...[AN]
I've been treating[N]
him since yesterday,[AN]
but he still hasn't[N]
begun to recover.[AN]
This wound...[AN]
he may have been shot[N]
with a poison arrow.[AN]
We acted quite late,[AN]
so I'm afraid it[N]
may have spread...[AN]
Even if he recovers,[AN]
there may still be[N]
traces left...[AN]

[FarRight]
Is that so...[AN]

[Left]
Mmm...[N][.....]
[CloseEyes][Beat][AN][.....][OpenEyes]
Oh! I'm sorry...[AN]
I haven't slept since yesterday...[N]
I think I need to take a break.[AN]
[Clear]


[Right][MoveMidLeft][Clear][MidLeft][LoadBarrelle][FarRight][MoveMidRight]
Is... is she serious?[N]
I'm really sorry for this...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't worry about it, Isaac.[AN]
In these times, helping each other[N]
is of the utmost importance.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, you're right.[N]
Thank you both.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Speaking of which, that knight girl...[N]
Is she your client or something?[AN]
She's been going around town helping[N]
people with things. Does she owe you?[AN]

[MidRight]
No, she's been hired[N]
by our ship's captain.[AN]
It would be his[N]
order, if anyone's.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, I see...[N]
Actually then...[AN]
Do they really care?[AN]

[MidRight]
They care about as much as we do.[AN]
In any case, once the request is over,[N]
we're going to be leaving this town.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh... that seems[N]
reasonable enough.[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
At this time...[Event][AN]

[MidRight]
Huh...?[N]
What's that noise?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Shh...[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Attention all citizens![AN]
You now have a unique right, the[N]
privilege and pleasure to serve Etruria![AN]
All capable men will assemble in[N]
the town square at once! I repeat...[AN][Event]

[MidRight]
This is...[AN]

[MidLeft]
No doubt about it.[AN]
The Etrurians have finally[N]
reached this town, too.[AN]
I wonder... did they[N]
know that we were here?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, what are[N]
we going to do?[AN]

[MidLeft]
We'll have to evacuate.[AN]
They're a small force at the moment,[N]
so we should leave before more arrive.[AN]
It's unfortuante, but... some of us[N]
may not be able to escape in time.[AN]

[MidRight]
It can't be helped...[N]
Let's work together, then.[AN]
We have a large enough group,[N]
from the resistance and the mine.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank you. Let's prepare then.[N]
But... wait. That knight girl.[AN]
She's still outside, right?[AN]

[MidRight]
[Beat][N]
No way...[A][X]



#0x997 Chapter8Opening4
[MidLeft][LoadLizzy]
Is it really possible...?[N]
Is what he said true?[AN]
Knights are supposed to[N]
protect everyone...[AN]
But, people are afraid?[N]
That just can't be true.[AN]
Well... maybe I can find[N]
out by talking to someone.[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Attention all citizens![AN]
You now have a unique right, the[N]
privilege and pleasure to serve Etruria![AN]
All capable men will assemble in[N]
the town square at once! I repeat...[AN]

[MidLeft]
H-huh?[N]
What's this?[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
No, noooooo![N]
Stop! Please, stop![AN]
I don't want to go![N]
I dooooont'!![AN]

[FarLeft]
No, please...[N]
Please let me go...[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Sir, please, sir![N]
Please have mercy![AN]

[MidLeft]
What... is happening?[AN]
There's suddenly screaming[N]
from all around the town...[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Somebody, help![N]
Somebody!![AN]

[MidLeft]
It's an Etrurian knight's[N]
duty to protect people...[AN]
I have to go help them![A][X]



#0x9BF Chapter8Opening5
[MidRight][LoadBlondeKid][MidLeft][LoadEvan]
Get over here![N]
You little brat![AN]

[MidRight]
No... no, no, no![N]
Please let me go sir![AN]
Please... sir...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't make me chase[N]
after you again.[AN]
[MoveMidLeft]

[MidRight]
Ack![AN]
[MoveMidRight]

[MidLeft]
Listen up, kid.[AN]
You've been given a great[N]
opportunity to serve Etruria.[AN]
What's so bad about that?[N]
It's a great honor, isn't it?![AN]
Well? Speak up![AN]

[MidRight]
Ugh...[AN]
[MoveMidRight]

[MidLeft]
Now get up, whelp.[N]
You're wasting my time.[AN]
Get on your knees[N]
and apologize to me.[AN]
If you make it quick[N]
I might forgive you.[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm? What's the matter?[N]
I said on your knees![AN]
Or do you need help?[N]
How about this![AN]
[MoveMidLeft]

[MidRight]
Ack...[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
Gahahaha![N]
You call that groveling?![AN]
Hands on the ground, kid![N]
There, was that so bad?[AN]

[MidRight][LoadBlondeKid]
Ugh...[AN]
Why do we have to[N]
suffer like this...[A][X]




#0x9AB Chapter8Opening6
[MidLeft][LoadLizzy]
What are you doing, kid?[N]
Get up on your feet, now.[AN]
This is no place to be[N]
kneeling down, you know...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadEvan]
Hmm?[AN]
What in blazes[N]
are you doing?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, I'm Lizzy.[N]
I'm an Etrurian knight like you.[AN]
What you're doing... You ought[N]
to be ashamed of yourself, sir![AN]
Bullying someone who can't fight back.[AN]
How terrible! Being a knight is about[N]
protecting those kinds of people![AN]
That's what our job is for![AN]

[MidRight]
Right, right...[N]
You're a... knight?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Get your foot off[N]
of that boy's head.[AN]

[MidRight]
What?[N]
You really don't...[AN]

[MidLeft]
You...![AN]
Get out of here now, or I'll[N]
force you to. Now scram![AN]

[MidRight]
Whoa, whoa! I'm an Etrurian knight.[N]
You'd point your sword at an ally?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That "knights" like you exist...[N]
I don't even want to think about it![AN]

[MidRight]
You're serious?[N]
You insolent child...[AN]
You need to be taught[N]
the rules around here.[AN]
I guess I'll have to[N]
give you a crash course![AN]

[MidLeft]
!![A][X]



#0x9DA Chapter8Opening7
[MidRight][LoadEvan][MidLeft][LoadLizzy][HalfCloseEyes]
Ugh... he's strong...[N]
Am I really losing to...[AN]
Someone like him...?[AN][HalfCloseEyes]

[MidRight]
Gahaha! Is vigor all you've got?[N]
How dare you talk down to me![AN]
You just wanted to sound high[N]
and mighty, didn't you?![AN]
Just keep watching... this runt[N]
will be killed as your warning...[AN]
This is what your weakness caused![AN]

[MidLeft]
No... stop it![A][X]



#0x9CC Chapter8Opening8
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Your opponent...[N]
Is me![A][X]



#0x9CA Chapter8Opening9
[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Get a hold of yourself![N]
We have to escape! Hurry![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadLizzy]
...![A][X]



#0x9C0 Chapter8Opening10
[MidLeft][LoadEvan]
Urg... Huh...[N]
...Oh! Emergency![AN]
It's the Resistance![AN]
Everyone, drop what you're[N]
doing and deal with them![AN]
Catch them at all costs![A][X]




#0x9CD Chapter8Opening11
[Right][LoadBarrelle][FarRight][LoadSelene][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
I'm sorry. Seems we started quite a mess.[N]
Those Etrurians seem to be looking for us.[AN]
I guess now is the time to strike back.[AN]

[Right]
Hmm... you may have a point.[N]
But, we're small in number.[AN]
I'm not sure we have a chance...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right now, our forces and[N]
theirs are about comparable.[AN]
We need to beat them before[N]
their reinforcements arrive.[AN]
I ask for your assistance.[AN]

[FarRight]
...There's no[N]
choice, Barrelle.[AN]
I'll help out, too![AN]

[Right]
Now isn't the time to be rattled.[N]
Alright. We'll help you out.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank you.[AN]

[Right][Clear][FarRight][Clear]
[MidRight][LoadLizzy][HalfCloseEyes]
...I'm so sorry.[AN]
This is... it's[N]
all my fault...[AN][HalfCloseEyes]

[MidLeft]
Your act was respectable as a knight,[N]
but inappropriate as an officer.[AN]
You should have thought more carefully[N]
about the repercussions of that.[AN]

[MidRight]
[Beat][N]
I just...[AN]
I just wanted to help someone in need...[N]
And right in front of me...![AN]

[MidLeft]
Let's save this for later and[N]
focus on what's in front of us.[AN]
...Just between you and me though,[N]
I respect what you did back there.[AN]

[MidRight]
...![A][X]


#0x9C7 Chapter8House
[MidRight][LoadActive][Left][LoadGingerMan][FarLeft][LoadElffin]
Ugh...[N]
Argh...[AN]

[Left]
We'll take care of[N]
him, don't worry.[AN]
You should focus on[N]
the enemies out there.[AN]
Oh, and, don't attract[N]
any attention over here.[AN]
Best of luck, friends![A][X]




#0x92A Chapter8Village
[MidLeft][LoadActive][MidRight][LoadOldMom]
Seems the Etrurians[N]
finally arrived here...[AN]
The rumors say that[N]
they take all the men,[AN]
and leave the women[N]
and children behind...[AN]
Then the town becomes[N]
infested with bandits.[AN]
Here, take this.[N]
Please, help us.[A][X]



#0x977 Chapter8Village2
[MidLeft][LoadActive][MidRight][LoadBlondeHairMan]
No... don't come closer![N]
Eh... wait...[AN]
You're no Etrurian soldier.[AN]
I was thinking of fighting back and[N]
dying instead of being taken to Eburacum.[AN]
But now that the Resistance is here...[AN]
Here, take this axe. It's quite weighty![N]
You may want to give it to someone strong.[A][X]



#0x949 Chapter8Village3
[MidRight][LoadActive][MidLeft][LoadMythra]
H-hey! You're from[N]
the Resistance, right?[AN]
Allow me to join you, please![AN]
I'm fed up with being trampled[N]
underfoot by those Etrurians![AN]
I'm sure my archery skills[N]
will be of use to you![A][X]



#0x9C8 Chapter8House2
[MidLeft][LoadActive][MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Shh! I'm a Reistance soldier[N]
sneaking into the Etrurian's ranks.[AN]
I'm not your enemy, don't worry.[AN]
I don't have much time, so[N]
I'll have to make this quick.[AN]
The Etrurian cavalry will[N]
be reinforcing from the south.[AN]
Watch out, and good luck![A][X]



#0x930 Chapter8Village4
[MidLeft][LoadActive][MidRight][LoadOldMan]
Oh, are you from the Resistance?[AN]
People around here heard[N]
what you did down in Eburacum.[AN]
Were I younger, I would join you...[N]
But alas, my age has caught up to me.[AN]
You're here to save our town, right?[AN]
Please take this. It's my old silver shield.[N]
It will protect you, just as you protect us.[A][X]




#0x92B Chapter8House3
[MidLeft][LoadActive][MidRight][LoadBraidGirl][CloseEyes]
My husband and sons were taken by them...[N]
Gods, what am I to do now... Agh...[AN]
Please... do something about them...![A][X]



#0x934 Chapter8Turn6
[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier][MidRight][LoadEvan]
Pathetic. How long does it[N]
take to wipe these scum out?![AN]

[MidLeft]
M-my apologies sir...[AN]
The enemy's counterattack[N]
was stronger than expected.[AN]

[MidRight]
Having trouble with them[N]
is most disappointing.[AN]
The cavalry reserves[N]
will be here before long.[AN]
When they arrive, crush[N]
them in one fell swoop.[AN]
Do I make myself clear?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes sir.[N]
Without fail.[A][X]



#0x975 Chapter8Turn10
[MidRight][LoadEvan][MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Evan![AN]
I've been informed a cavalry[N]
platoon is being sent our way.[AN]

[MidRight]
Excellent. To think this would[N]
become such a tough battle...[AN]
Hopefully this can turn[N]
the tides in our favor.[A]

[MidLeft]
Another thing, sir...[AN]
It seems bandits are taking[N]
advantage of the situation,[AN]
and attacking the citizenry...[AN]

[MidRight]
Leave them be. Focus on[N]
the Resistance, first.[AN]
How can we worry about[N]
bandits at a time like this?[A][X]



#0x9D0 Chapter8EvanDeath
[MidLeft][LoadEvan]
Ha... hahaha...[N]
This is... no use...[AN]
You will struggle...[N]
To your last breath...[AN]
You'll regret... this...[A][CloseEyes][.....][X]



#0xA39 Chapter8EvenLizzyBattle
[MidRight][LoadLizzy][MidLeft][LoadEvan]
Oh, so it's you again, huh?[AN]
An Etrurian knight siding[N]
with the Resistance...[AN]
Have you no shame, girl?[AN]

[MidRight]
Shame? Never! I fight[N]
for what I believe in![AN]
This time, I defeat you![AN]

[MidLeft]
Just like before,[N]
all bark and no bite.[AN]
Alright, come![A][X]



#0x9CF Chapter8EvanBattle
[MidLeft][LoadEvan]
Don't make light of Etrurian[N]
knights, Resistance scum![AN]
I'll see you lying cold[N]
and dead on the ground![A][X]



#0x94 Chapter8Guide
[MidLeft][LoadYggdra]
Save suspend data?[N]
[Yes]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
What do you do[N]
if I say neither?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'll figure it out when it happens.[N]
Well then, let's get into tactics.[AN]
You don't have a strict time limit,[N]
but you still want to move quickly.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, I can see bandits scattered about.[N]
No doubt the people's homes are in danger.[AN]

[MidLeft]
More bandits will arrive overtime.[AN]
Naturally they'll be attacking the homes,[N]
so you should try to split up to cover them.[AN]
Some [Red]cavalry will also arrive to the west,[Red][N]
so don't be getting caught offgaurd.[AN]
If you've [Red]challanged yourself[Red], there will[N]
be even more arriving shortly afterwards.[AN]

[MidRight]
Dealing with the bandits and Etrurians...[AN]
We'll have to keep busy. It also[N]
seems like there's powerful enemies.[AN]
It may be easier if we make use of[N]
any [Red]promotion items [Red]we've gathered here.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Remember that mastery skills won't activate[N]
until you reach S rank in your weapon.[AN]
For now, [Red]the enemies aren't able to use them.[Red][AN]

[MidRight]
For now, huh...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't take it for granted.[N]
Well, that's all for now.[AN]
Let me know if you need to[N]
record your progress, okay?[A][X]




#0x9D1 Chapter8Ending1
[Right][LoadIsaac][FarRight][LoadLizzy][MidLeft][LoadBarrelle]
No way...[AN]
All those Etrurians,[N]
and yet... we won?[AN]

[Right]
Seems to be so.[N]
But, Barrelle...[AN]
What will you do next time?[AN]
We've repelled them for now,[N]
but surely they'll be back.[AN]

[MidLeft]
...I know. We've had enough time[N]
for the citizens to evacuate.[AN]
Though I'm afraid not everyone made it...[AN]

[FarRight]
That... can't be true...[N]
Barelle, I'm sorry...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hey, no need to apoligize, little knight.[AN]
The real problem is those rich windbags,[N]
paying off the knights to turn on the people...[AN]
Of all the Etrurian knights I've met, you're[N]
the first to be more than a glorified merc.[AN]
Consider it a sign of my respect.[N]
You're what a real knight should be like.[AN]

[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
O-of course...[AN]
I'm just doing my[N]
duty as a knight.[AN][ToggleSmile]

[MidLeft]
Well said. There aren't many people willing[N]
to stand up for their honor like you did.[AN]

[FarRight][Beat]
You'd...[N]
Um...[AN]

[Right]
Heh, I guess you're not used to praise.[N]
You look completely flabbergasted.[AN]

you'd excuse me![AN]
[MoveFarRight][Clear]
[Right][MoveMidRight]

[MidLeft]
Ahaha, you trying to tease me, Isaac?[N]
Anyways, have you decided what to do?[AN]
If you're still set on leaving,[N]
I'd probably do it quickly.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm not so sure.[AN]
I personally[N]
will be staying.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I know how you feel, but...[N]
I wouldn't do that if I were you.[AN]
The Schwarzritter have been[N]
working behind the scenes,[AN]
throwing people into the mines.[AN]
They're encircling the island,[N]
growing closer and closer,[AN]
targetting our people down.[AN]
You should go before they find[N]
you. Hell, they may have already.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's...[N]
[Beat][AN]
Could you run that[N]
name by me again?[AN]

[MidLeft]
You're joking, right?[N]
Yet your face is dead serious...[AN]
The Schwarzritter. The[N]
Black Knights, if you would.[AN]
Just saying it gives me chills...[AN]

[MidRight]
...Thanks for the info.[N]
If you'd excuse me.[AN]

be kidding...[A][X]


#0x102B Chapter8Ending2
[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadCarl]
What do you think of[N]
your duties, Isaac?[AN]
It certainly isn't[N]
glorius work.[AN]
You'll gain neither[N]
fame nor honor.[AN]
I wonder... do you have[N]
any pride as a knight?[AN]

[MidRight]
General Carl?[AN]
What's gotten into[N]
you all of a sudden?[AN]
Well... it's true that[N]
our work isn't very grand.[AN]
I'm sure nobody will be[N]
celebrating for us.[AN]
We know, however.[AN]
We know we're fighting to[N]
prevent a terrible war,[AN]
one that would take the[N]
lives of so many.[AN]
In that, I have pride.[AN]
Even if I cannot become a[N]
knight of some fairytale.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I am sorry to involve[N]
you in this, Isaac.[AN]
I'm sure you would[N]
have preferred more...[AN]
More savory work.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's not[N]
a problem.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You don't have to hide it.[N]
I heard it from your attendent.[AN]
Right now, the kingdom is[N]
rife with shady business.[AN]
If left alone, it will surely[N]
become a spark for another war.[AN]
And once again, many innocent[N]
lives will be smothered out.[AN]
I am glad to hear you have[N]
pride in your work like I do.[AN]
Let us both work together,[N]
for the sake of Etruria.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, General.[N]
For Etruria![A][X]

...Isaac, all the[N]

What did you need us all[N]
for on such short notice?[AN]

[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
Thanks, Audrey.[AN]
Alright, everyone. Some of you have[N]
nothing to do with this, but...[AN][Event]
A while ago, the Resistance gave[N]
me some... troubling information.[AN]
The Schwarzritter are here on the isles.[AN]
It seems Roartz figured out our[N]
location and has sent them after us.[AN]

[FarFarRight][Beat][AN]

[MidRight]
Roartz...[N]
He trapped General[N]
Carl and us...[AN]
I won't forgive that![AN]

[MidLeft]
For those of us expelled from the[N]
country, there is a great risk here.[AN]
Yet... I will not be leaving the islands.[AN]
I won't make you stay here with me.[N]
You are free to leave if you so choose.[AN]

[MidRight]
But why, Isaac?[N]
What will you do?[AN]
We've been wandering[N]
to run from them.[AN]
But you want to stay here[N]
and let them find you...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
...It's atonement.[AN]

[MidRight]
That knight girl, huh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I killed her brother.[AN]
Now she lives with[N]
her own strange fate.[AN]
I want to do my duty.[AN]

As your caretaker, I musn't[N]
leave my young master by himself.[AN][Event]

Me too, Commander![AN]
That guy robbed me of my[N]
career as an officer![AN]
I'll never forgive them![AN]

[FarFarLeft]
I'll follow you, commander.[N]
It's what I've always been best at.[AN]

[FarFarRight]
You must still need[N]
my help, right, Isaac?[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Oi, boss man! Never forget[N]
that ya can count on me![AN]

[FarFarRight]
...Don't be[N]
conceited.[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
It's my turn to help[N]
you now, Commander.[AN]

[FarFarRight]
Gahaha! We've always[N]
been through hell together![AN]
Damned if I'm sitting[N]
this one out, Isaac![AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Oh, Commander! Do you need an[N]
extra pair of hands? I know you do![AN]

[FarFarRight]
Family always help[N]
each other out![AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Heh, I'll toss my hat[N]
in the ring for ya, chief.[AN]

[FarFarRight]
If you die, you'll need[N]
someone to cremate you, right?[AN]

[MidRight]
Seems like that's everybody.[AN]
We've overcome a lot together,[N]
haven't we, Commander?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Everyone...[AN]
We'll be facing[N]
tough battles ahead.[AN]
I hope you all[N]
won't regret this.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLizzy][MidLeft][LoadLarum]
I can't believe something like[N]
this was going on in the Western Isles...[AN]

[MidRight]
This place doesn't[N]
feel very safe...[AN]

[MidLeft]
But with Elffin like this,[AN]
I don't think he has the[N]
strength to travel by boat...[AN]
Dad entrusted this to me...[N]
Oh, what do I do...[AN]

[FarFarRight]
Excuse me.[AN]

[MidLeft]
!![AN]

[Clear][MidRight][Clear][FarLeft][LoadLarum][Left][LoadLizzy][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Elffin... doesn't look to be[N]
doing much better, I see.[AN]

[FarLeft]
We need to keep a close eye on him.[N]
I'm very grateful for all your help.[AN]
You were leaving today, right?[AN]

[MidRight]
About that...[AN]

[FarLeft]
?[AN]

[Left]
?[AN]

[MidRight]
We intend to stay on the isles, for now.[AN]
Actually, I was going to ask you a favor.[N]
Would you be willing to hire us?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Um... did you happen to hear[N]
what we were saying earlier?[AN]

[MidRight]
What?[AN]
I'm sorry, I don't[N]
know what you mean.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Oh, nevermind then...[AN]

[MidRight]
I don't feel comfortable[N]
leaving a job half done.[AN]
I'd feel bad about leaving[N]
you here on this island.[AN]
Maybe we're more troublesome[N]
than I think we are...[AN]
But, what do you think?[AN]

[Left]
Larum... I think you should hire them.[N]
They're not worth your suspicion.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Well, you might be right...[AN]
We don't have much choice anyways.[N]
Alright, you're officially hired.[AN]

[MidRight]
Thank you.[AN]
Then, we'll follow[N]
your orders from here.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Then you better all[N]
get ready to work hard![AN]

[Left]
Ahaha...[N]
Larum...[A][X]

aren't around...[AN]

[Left]
!![AN]

[MidRight]
Ow...[AN]
Hey hey, wait[N]
a minute...![AN]

[FarLeft]
Isaac, he's one of us.[N]
Can you lower your sword?[AN]

[Left]
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you[N]
were an enemy. Forgive me.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][LoadYoungMan]
Whew, that[N]
was scary...[AN]

[FarLeft]
So how is it out there?[AN]

[MidRight]
Our allies are buying us time[N]
by pulling over their carts.[AN]
Seems they haven't gotten very far.[N]
We can still catch up if we move now.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Great. Then let's gather everyone[N]
and go get those people back.[AN]

[Left]
What are our orders,[N]
Miss Larum?[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][LoadLarum]
Well, we owe these guys a lot,[N]
so of course we should help them![AN]

[Left]
But we can't leave Elffin alone...[N]
Miss Larum, will you stay with him?[AN]
We'll handle things on our own.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hum... alright![N]
I'll leave it to you![AN]

[Clear][LoadYoungMan]
Then let's go[N]
and help everyone![A][X]




#0x9CE Chapter8Ending6
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Sorry we're late.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadGeese]
Never expected to[N]
encounter Etrurians so fast.[AN]
Seems like bad luck, eh?[N]
We should be goin' soon.[AN]
After all, they might be[N]
back before we know it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Um, actually...[AN]
We've decided[N]
to stay here.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, really?[AN]
Ya seemed to want to[N]
leave pretty badly...[AN]
What changed yer mind?[AN]
Actually, I won't ask.[N]
I know that look in yer eyes.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It was only a short while, but[N]
you were a great help. Thank you.[AN]

[MidRight]
Don't mention it, lad.[N]
We do business on the isles.[AN]
We may bump into each[N]
other again if we're lucky.[AN]
I'll count on ya then![AN]

[MidLeft]
Likewise.[AN]

[MidRight]
Good luck to ya, lad![N]
Hope we'll both be okay![AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, to the[N]
both of us.[A][X]

[Right][LoadIsaac][FarRight][LoadLarum][MidLeft][LoadBarrelle]
It's out of the blue,[N]
but I have an idea.[AN]

[FarRight]
Hmm?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Unfortunately, we can't stay here.[N]
After all, those knights will be back.[AN]
So, if you like... how about you come[N]
to another Resistance base with us?[AN]
We can treat that bard fellow better[N]
without all this commotion going on.[AN]

[Right]
It's not a bad idea.[N]
What do you think, Miss Larum?[AN]

[FarRight]
Well, we don't have much choice...[N]
Then, please allow us to join you![AN]
We'll be sure to help out, too![AN]

[Right][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
Haha, that's great news![N]
I'll be counting on you.[AN]
Let's get moving now then.[N]
We don't want to stick around.[AN]

[Right]
By the way, how[N]
long is the trip?[AN]

[MidLeft]
About a day by carriage.[AN]
We'll have to use multiple and split[N]
them up to not look suspicious.[AN]

[FarRight]
Oh, that's fast![AN]

[Right]
Assuming nothing[N]
happens on the way...[A][X]




#0x9BA Chapter8Ending8
[MidLeft][LoadHaguro][ToggleSmile]
Hehehe... soon...[AN]
Soon we can finally be[N]
together again... Commander...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadGalius]
You look happy, Haguro.[AN]
Seems you already know the[N]
Nameless' location, then.[AN]
And that Resistance base.[AN]
Looks like working together[N]
has paid off, hasn't it?[AN]
Teamwork is such a wonderful[N]
thing, wouldn't you agree?[AN]

[MidLeft]
...Mr. Galius.[AN]
You remember, don't you?[N]
Your promise to me...[AN]

[MidRight]
But of course. We will[N]
destroy the Nameless...[AN]
but leave Isaac alone for you.[N]
Does that satisfy you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes! That's perfect![N]
I'm so happy to hear that...[AN]
I can kill them all with[N]
no worries, then...[AN]
Ah, Commander Isaac...[N]
How I yearn to see you...[AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight]
Gahaha![AN]
She's almost as crazy as me.[N]
She makes a wonderful ally.[A][X]
