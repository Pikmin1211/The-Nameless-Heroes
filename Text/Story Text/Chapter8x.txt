[MidLeft][LoadBarrelle][Right][LoadIsaac][FarRight][LoadLizzy]
These villages...[N]
All savagely looted...[AN]
I'm... I'm sorry.[AN]
If I had just...[N]
If I had known...[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's just the reality of[N]
these islands, I'm afraid.[AN]
The powerless are at the[N]
mercy of the Etrurians.[AN]
What a wretched place.[AN]
Any sign of defiance is[N]
met with a burned village,[AN]
and innocent people sent[N]
to die in those mines.[AN]
They mask their demands[N]
like they're requests...[AN]
But there is no doubt.[AN]
The Etrurian lords are the[N]
aboslute authority here.[AN]

[Right]
So, that's why you're so vocal[N]
about being resistance troops.[AN]
On the field it seems foolish[N]
to paint a target on yourself,[AN]
but you're trying not to get[N]
innocent villagers involved.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's about right.[AN]
If the Etrurians thought it[N]
was the villagers dissenting,[AN]
who knows what kind of things[N]
they would do to them...[AN]
Plus, it helps spread word[N]
about the Resistance.[AN]
...Looks like we're catching[N]
up to our enemies about now.[AN]
It's late, so I would think[N]
they'd be resting somewhere.[AN]

[FarRight]
I see lights up ahead...[N]
Could that be them?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, it is.[AN]
They're lined[N]
up in formation.[AN]

[Right]
Not good. Seems like they[N]
noticed something's wrong.[AN]

[MidLeft]
If they were just resting, then[N]
they'll need time to mobilize.[AN]
If we hurry we can catch up.[AN]
The further the distance between[N]
us, the harder this will become.[AN]
I want to save these people.[N]
I'm counting on your support.[AN]

[FarRight]
Right![N]
Let's go![A][2X][X]



#0x999 Chapter8xOpening2

[MidLeft][LoadEvil][MidRight][LoadMoneyMan]
Mr. Evil, sir...[N]
We've brought your meals.[AN]
It is a pleasure to have you[N]
stay at our humble village,[AN]
during your important mission.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Is this all? Just scraps?![N]
Bring more alcohol and women![AN]
More!! You bumbling old fool![N]
You ingrates owe your lives to us![AN]
It is your duty to serve us![AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
What's the matter?[AN]
...Oh, I see. That[N]
look in your eyes...[AN]
Planning to rebel,[N]
are you? Hmm?[AN]

[MidRight]
N-no...[N]
No, sir...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Bah. You bore me.[N]
Away with you![AN]

[MidRight]
As you[N]
wish, sir...[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
This mission is dreadfully boring...[AN]
At least being able to shove these[N]
fools around makes it tolerable.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir Evil! I have[N]
something to report![AN]
There's a group[N]
approaching our rear.[AN]
It appears to be[N]
Resistance soldiers.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Those Resistance scum.[AN]
They thought our[N]
guard was down, hmm?[AN]
Order the waiting troops[N]
to prepare an assault,[AN]
and the wagons to flee.[AN]
I'll prepare my little[N]
arachnid friends as well.[AN]
They challenged Etruria,[N]
so we show them its might![AN]

[MidRight]
Yes sir![N]
On the double![A][2X][X]



#0x9A3 Chapter8xEnding

[FarLeft][LoadIsaac][Left][LoadLizzy][MidRight][LoadBlondeHairMan]
Oh, thank god![N]
We're finally safe...[AN]

[Clear][LoadYoungMan]
Ahhh... I'm so relieved.[N]
Really relieved...[AN]
[Clear]

[Left][Clear][MidRight][LoadLizzy]
I'm really glad we[N]
made it in time...[AN]
[CloseEyes]
Oh...? I'm also...[N]
shedding tears...?[AN]
[OpenEyes]

[FarLeft][Beat][AN]

[FarFarRight]
Tears of joy, huh?[AN]
Better than tears[N]
of grief, aren't they?[AN]
[ClearSpeech]

[MidRight][Clear][Left][LoadLizzy][MidRight][LoadBarrelle]
So, did you take a look?[AN]
What we just stole back[N]
from those transporters.[AN]
A mountainous pile, ain't it?[N]
No wonder they get so rich.[AN]

[Left]
Quite a lot of[N]
food and money...[AN]
Was it all taken[N]
from villagers?[AN]

[MidRight]
So it seems. I can[N]
almost see their smiles,[AN]
knowing that the lords[N]
won't be coming back.[AN]
We'll use it all well.[AN]
Distribute it among[N]
the Resistance forces.[AN]
But, before that,[N]
I'll give this to you.[AN]
Consider it payment[N]
for your hard work.[A][2X][X]



#0x996 Chapter8xBadEnding

[MidRight][LoadBarrelle][FarLeft][LoadIsaac][Left][LoadLizzy]
No... we couldn't[N]
save them after all...[AN]

[FarLeft][Beat][AN]

[MidRight]
Gods damn it all![AN]
They had the[N]
edge over us...[AN]

[FarLeft]
What do[N]
we do now?[AN]

[MidRight]
Now that they've gotten away,[N]
there's nothing more we can do.[AN]
I'm sorry, lad. I wasted our time.[AN]
Let's hurry on back to Deil.[N]
The others are waiting there...[AN]

[FarLeft][Beat][AN]

[Left][Beat][A][2X][X]


#0x966 Chapter8xRangeEvent

[MidLeft][LoadEvil][MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir Evil, the enemy troop[N]
has almost made it here![AN]
You should evacuate now![AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm... seems I've[N]
underestimated them.[AN]
At this rate, they'll[N]
rob our transporters.[AN]
I guess it's time to[N]
enact my backup plan...[AN]
Alright then, soldier![AN]
Take those villagers and[N]
line them up in a row.[AN]
We must buy time for the[N]
transporters to escape![AN]

[MidRight]
Sir! Yes, sir![N]
Right away![AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
Heheh, those miserable lot will[N]
serve well as our shields...[AN]

[MidLeft][Clear]
[FarLeft][LoadLoli][Right][LoadBrownHairMan][FarRight][LoadBlondeHairMan][Left][LoadKelikGirl]
W-what are they going[N]
to do with us...?[AN]

[FarLeft]
I'm scared...[AN]

[Right][Beat][AN]

[FarRight]
I hope we'll be able[N]
to return home alive...[A][2X][X]



#0x95A Chapter8xRangeEvent2
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
They would go so far as to use[N]
innocents for defensive line...[AN]
Apparently, they hold no value[N]
on human life. Despicable...[AN]
Everyone, do not harm the[N]
civilians. Pay attention.[A][2X][X]



#0xAC5 Chapter8xVillage1
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadGingerMan]
All the lords on this[N]
island are greedy,[AN]
exploitative bandits.[AN]
This island used to be[N]
peaceful and prosperous,[AN]
until that dastard Arcard[N]
showed up... Gods damn him.[A][2X][X]



#0x95E Chapter8xVillage2
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadMoneyMan]
Ah, welcome, Resistance.[AN]
Up ahead is a dreadful[N]
sorcerer named Evil.[AN]
All who stood against him[N]
were killed by his dark magic.[AN]
Those who survived were taken[N]
away as sacrifice for...[AN]
For God knows what terrors.[N]
Here, take this staff.[AN]
It's a special staff that[N]
can heal allies from far away.[AN]
It was supposed to be given[N]
to the Etrurian lords...[AN]
But I've had enough of them.[AN]
Please be a beacon of hope[N]
in these dark, dreary times.[A][2X][X]



#0x92D Chapter8xHouse
[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadGingerMan]
Lots of horse-drawn carriages[N]
passed by here pretty quickly.[AN]
I'd bet they're carrying goods[N]
stolen from the nearby villages.[AN]
Sorry to say, but I can't join[N]
you. I prefer a peaceful life.[AN]
On that note, I don't want[N]
to be drawing attention here,[AN]
so could you please leave?[A][2X][X]



#0x99F Chapter8xVSEvil
[MidLeft][LoadEvil]
Hmph, seems my men are[N]
incompetent as ever.[AN]
Taste the power of[N]
my elder magic![A][2X][X]



#0x9A0 Chapter8xEvilDeath
[MidLeft][LoadEvil]
Damn you...[N]
Gods damn you...![A][2X][X]



#0x5F Chapter8xGuide
Wrys:[N]
Welcome back, sir Isaac.[N]
This is the guide corner,[N]
which gives you tactical advice.[N]
Is something the matter?[AN]
[N]
Isaac:[N]
Sir Wrys, isn't it...[N]
different than usual?[AN]
[N]
Wrys:[N]
I think you're just[N]
imagining things.[AN]
Now then, let's begin.[N]
You must chase down[N]
those transporters,[N]
but your [Red]vision is reduced.[Red][AN]
[N]
Isaac:[N]
We're the pursuers in the[N]
darkness. Sounds difficult.[AN]
We'll need to move quickly,[N]
but also move carefully.[AN]
[N]
Wrys:[N]
That's right. But don't worry.[N]
Even [Red]destroying one transporter[N]
would be a successful mission.[Red][AN]
There's five wagons in all,[N]
but two of them will only begin[N]
to escape once you move closer.[AN]
[N]
Isaac:[N]
I see. So if we're in a rough spot,[N]
it may be better not to push[N]
ourselves to try and catch them all.[AN]
I'm a bit concerned about those[N]
mountains. It's difficult to see.[AN]
[N]
Wrys:[N]
Their leader, the sorcerer Evil,[N]
has mastered control over his familiars.[AN]
They are [Red]giant spiders[Red], and they[N]
offer little reward for their defeat.[A][2X][X]



#0x99 Chapter8xGuide2
Isaac:[N]
Giant spiders? I've never[N]
heard of such creatures before.[AN]
[N]
Wrys:[N]
They are summoned to[N]
this realm from another.[AN]
[N]
Isaac:[N]
I see...[AN]
[N]
Wrys:[N]
By the way, [Red]defeating any[N]
innocents will result in[N]
a failure of the mission,[Red][AN]
as you might expect.[AN]
[N]
Isaac:[N]
I'll keep my eyes open for[N]
any civilians on the field.[AN]
[N]
Wrys:[N]
I wish you[N]
good luck.[AN]
[N]
Isaac:[N]
Until next[N]
time, then.[A][2X][X]



#0x99C Chapter8xTransporterDeath
[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Damn it! We're toppling over![AN]
Hey, the horses... Wait![N]
Get back here, you two![A][2X][X]
