[MidRight][LoadLizzy]
Oh... Larum?[AN]
What are you[N]
doing here?[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadLarum]
A-ahh![AN]
[MoveMidLeft]
W-who's there?![AN]
Oh... Lizzy...[N]
Why are you up?[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm just having a bit[N]
of trouble sleeping.[AN]
I thought a walk might[N]
help clear my thoughts.[AN]
So, what are you doing[N]
awake at this hour?[AN]
Are you practicing?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well...[N]
I can't tell you that yet.[AN]
It's a dance, but I won't[N]
tell you more than that![AN]
This time of day... er...[AN]
This time of night is[N]
perfect for solo practice![AN]

[MidRight]
Well, it seems you're busy.[N]
Sorry for interrupting you.[AN]
I'll take my leave then...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Gosh! If you want to be so[N]
persistant, Liz, I guess...[AN]
If you want to see it, I[N]
could show you. Interested?[AN]

[MidRight]
N-no, that's okay![N]
I'm just gonna...[AN]
Continue on my[N]
walk, alright?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Heehee, well, if[N]
you say so then![AN]

[MidRight]
Haha, it's nice to[N]
see you smile again.[AN]
I'm relieved.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You're one to talk, Liz![AN]
From what I can see, you[N]
bear such a heavy burden...[AN]
Compared to that, well,[N]
what I'm feeling is nothing.[AN]
Your father in law gave me this[N]
escort job in the first place.[AN]
I felt so relieved when the[N]
Resistance took Elffin in.[AN]
I wanted to thank them. I had[N]
to repay the favor somehow.[AN]
Dancing is all I know, so...[AN]
For Elffin's sake, I want to[N]
dance for the people here.[AN]
But, Liz... you don't feel[N]
safe in here, do you?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, not exactly,[N]
but... Hey, Larum.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Mhmm?[AN]

[MidRight]
What do you plan on doing?[N]
Y'know, when Elffin is better?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, that's Elffin's[N]
choice, really...[AN]
If it was up to me...[AN]
I'd like to continue to[N]
help out the Resistance.[AN]
I'm sure Elffin would[N]
be a great help, too.[AN]

[MidRight]
In that case, Larum,[N]
I want to help you too.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Aw... thank you, Liz.[N]
Now then, enough chitchat...[AN]
It's time for me to dance![A][2X][X]

U-um...[N]
Mr. Isaac![AN]

[MidLeft]
Ah, if it isn't Miss Lizzy.[N]
Did you need something?[AN]

[MidRight]
There was something I wanted[N]
to talk about, actually.[AN]
I've learned a lot from you,[AN]
but I still feel like there's[N]
something stuck between us.[AN]
I think the reason is because[N]
of how we speak to each other![AN]
[MoveMidRight]
What I mean is... maybe we[N]
should speak more casually?[AN]
Like... I could stop calling[N]
you "Sir" or "Mister" Isaac.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm... I think[N]
it's a good idea.[AN]
That's fine with[N]
me, Lady Lizzy.[AN]
Address me however[N]
you would like.[AN]

[MidRight]
O-oh, um...[AN]
I mean,[N]
that's not...[AN]

[MidLeft]
...Lizzy.[AN]
I look forward to[N]
working with you.[AN]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yeah![N]
As do I![AN]
[Clear][ToggleSmile]

#0x60 Chapter9BaseIsaacAudreyTalk
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
Echidna and the others should be[N]
in the middle of their meeting.[AN]
Isaac, you were summoned to[N]
that meeting too, weren't you?[AN]
Is it okay for you to be here...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, it seems like there's nothing[N]
I need to be at the meeting for.[AN]
It's late now, so I'm going to bed.[AN]

[MidRight]
Just don't be up[N]
drinking again.[AN]

[MidLeft]
What makes you[N]
say that...?[AN]

[MidRight]
You snore really loudly, Isaac.[AN]
They say drinking before bed[N]
is a bad habit, you know.[AN]

[MidLeft]
...Am I[N]
that loud?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yup, in fact, I can hear[N]
you from a few rooms away.[AN]

[MidLeft]
...I guess I'll[N]
refrain for tonight.[A][2X][X]



#0x5E Chapter9BaseJesterBarrelleTalk
[MidRight][LoadBarrelle][MidLeft][LoadJester]
Hey, Sir Barrelle. What[N]
are you doing here?[AN]
Weren't you supposed to[N]
be in that meeting?[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, Jester. We're just taking a break.[N]
Things got a little heated in there.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Heating up, you say? Sounds like a[N]
good way to start our next mission![AN]

[MidRight]
Huh? No,[N]
that's...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh?[AN]

[MidRight]
What I meant is...[N]
Well, we got off to a bad start.[AN]
There's been some troubling intel.[AN]
They suspect someone is leaking our[N]
information to the Etrurians.[AN]

[MidLeft]
What?! Are you saying someone[N]
in the Resistance is a traitor?![AN]

[MidRight]
Quiet down, lad. I don't think so.[AN]
With our defeats lately, everyone[N]
is getting a little too on edge.[AN]
I have a feeling that's why the[N]
others are becoming so wary.[AN]
Echidna was trying to keep the[N]
others in line, but that was it.[AN]
Oh, it looks like the meeting is[N]
about to resume, so I'll be going.[AN]
It's late, so get some sleep, lad.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, sir![A][2X][X]



#0x9B5 Chapter9BaseIsaacMythraTalk
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadMythra]
Aah! If it isn't Sir[N]
Isaac. Good evening![AN]

[MidLeft]
Mythra, it's late. Where[N]
are you going at this hour?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, I was thinking[N]
of getting a drink...[AN]
Care to join me, Isaac?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I appreciate it, but I was[N]
actually just on my way to bed.[AN]
Sorry, but maybe another time.[AN]

[MidRight]
Aw, really? What a shame![N]
But you owe me next time![AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
She doesn't seem like a grown woman[N]
no matter how you look at it...[AN]
Well, maybe that's rude of me...[A][2X][X]



#0xA6E Chapter9BaseSeleneLarumTalk
[MidLeft][LoadLarum]
Wow, that's such[N]
a pretty dance![AN]

[MidRight][LoadSelene]
...Oh dear, were[N]
you watching me?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, I watched you a lot![AN]
Your moves are all so[N]
romantic and mysterious...[AN]
There's something magical[N]
about the way you dance.[AN]

[MidRight]
My mother used to[N]
perform this dance.[AN]
Sadly... she's no[N]
longer with us.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Hey, so, what was[N]
your mother like?[AN]

[MidRight]
She was famous all[N]
over the continent.[AN]
A woman I admired and[N]
dreamt to be like...[AN]
But also a woman that[N]
I deeply despised.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
You despised your[N]
own mother? Why?[AN]

[MidRight]
Every time I danced[N]
I could hear it...[AN]
They would murmur the[N]
name of my mother...[AN]
And I hated it. They[N]
always compared us.[AN]
I got so fed up that[N]
I stopped dancing.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, it was amazing[N]
to watch you just now.[AN]
You shouldn't quit![N]
That's what I believe.[AN]

[MidRight]
You're the reason I chose[N]
to dance again, you know.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh? Me?[AN]

[MidRight]
Watching you dance, you[N]
seemed to shine like the sun.[AN]
It reminded me of how I used[N]
to dream about my mother...[AN]
And when I saw that, I knew[N]
I couldn't lose to you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Heheh, well, you picked a[N]
formidable rival, you know.[AN]

[MidRight]
Haha! Well, we'll see if[N]
you can keep up with me.[AN]

[MidLeft][Clear]
[MidRight]
Mother...[AN]
I carry in my veins the[N]
rhythm of your dance.[AN]
I won't... let you down![A][2X][X]



#0x91E Chapter9BaseIsaacHermesTalk
[MidLeft][LoadHermes][CloseEyes]
Man, it's late. Business is[N]
slow as usual at this hour...[AN]
[OpenEyes]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Sorry if I'm bothering[N]
you at this hour, Hermes.[AN]
The sign still said "open",[N]
so I thought I'd stop by.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, it's you, sir![N]
Sorry you had to see that...[AN]
Um, is there something[N]
you're looking for tonight?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, I had nothing[N]
particular in mind.[AN]
I'd like to see what[N]
you have to offer,[AN]
if that's alright.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, yes![N]
Of course, sir![AN]
Then let me present[N]
you something...[AN]
How about this...[N]
The Blizzard tome![AN]
What do you think?[AN]

[MidRight]
Are you feeling[N]
tired, by chance?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, no! I'm fine, really.[N]
More importantly, the tome![AN]
The enemy first will feel[N]
a sudden chill in the air...[AN]
Then, they will be lulled[N]
into a cold, deep sleep.[AN]
I imagine being lost in the[N]
Ilian mountains is like that.[AN]

[MidRight]
That's... pretty[N]
gruesome to imagine.[AN]
So, what's the price?[AN]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
A mere 3,000 gold...[N]
What... uh....[OpenEyes][AN]
What do you think?[AN]

[MidRight]
I knew he[N]
was sleepy...[A][2X][X]



#0xFC0 Chapter9BaseIsaacHermesYes
[MidRight]
Alright. Here's[N]
the gold then.[AN]

[MidLeft][CloseEyes]
Th... thank you.[N]
Here's your...[AN]
Merchan... dise.[OpenEyes][AN]

[MidRight]
Wake up, Hermes.[AN]
You'll catch a cold if[N]
you fall asleep here.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, sorry... Isaac...[AN]
I'm gonna head home and[N]
get some shut-eye now...[AN]

[MidRight]
Have a[N]
good night.[A][2X][X]
