Good grief. Well, I'm[N]
glad that's all settled.[AN]
Are we good? Can we stop[N]
talking about traitors?[AN]
We don't have to go[N]
through all this...[AN]
finger pointing right[N]
now, don't you agree?[AN]
There's no evidence,[AN]
so it shouldn't even[N]
be open for debate.[AN]

[Right][Beat][AN]
[FarRight][Beat][AN]
[FarFarLeft][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
Good. Then let's address[N]
more important matters.[AN]
Calvin, what do you think[N]
about our current situation?[AN]

[Right]
Since the Eburacum insident,[AN]
Etruria has stepped up both[N]
their offense and oppression.[AN]
Let me make this clear...[N]
we continue to lose our battles.[AN]
Lately, we've faced so many defeats,[N]
our morale has gone to the gutter.[AN]
People suspect there is some sort[N]
of compromise to our operation...[AN]
As you may know from earlier.[AN]

[FarRight]
It's more likely that they've[N]
been able to read our strategy,[AN]
then that there's a spy going around.[AN]
They may be rotten and without morals,[N]
but they're still educated soldiers.[AN]

[MidLeft]
The experience gap is unfortunately[N]
not something we have control over.[AN]
This is certainly a tough situation.[AN]
Don't we have any more experienced[N]
soldiers at our disposal...?[AN]

[FarRight]
I wish I had good[N]
news for you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't sweat it.[AN]
Argh... it's frustrating,[N]
but we have no choice.[AN]
We'll have to move in to[N]
reinforce our troops,[AN]
now that the Etrurians[N]
are more aggressive.[AN]
We'll need some plan to[N]
make up our disadvantage...[AN]
I've got no ideas for any[N]
sort of counterattack.[AN]

[Right]
That sounds like the[N]
best course of action.[AN]

[FarRight]
I agree with you.[AN]
We should save our[N]
strength for now.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thanks for your support, everyone.[N]
Then we'll enact this right away.[AN]
What a meeting this has been...[AN]
I'm sorry to say it, but we'll[N]
be laying low for the time being.[AN]
Does anyone have any objections?[AN]

[Right]
Let's[N]
do it![AN]

[FarRight]
Right.[AN]

[MidLeft]
So... shall we[N]
call it here, then?[AN]
It's starting[N]
to get late...[AN][Event]
What in the...?![N]
What was that?[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
I can't believe[N]
they found us here...[AN]
No way! It has[N]
to a traitor![AN]
No way that they[N]
found us otherwise![AN]

[FarLeft]
I knew there[N]
was a traitor...[AN]

[FarFarRight]
Who could[N]
it be...?[AN]

[FarRight]
Well, this went south quickly.[N]
What a complicated situation.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Quiet down, all of you![AN]
You better not be sitting[N]
around instead of investigating.[AN]
Bunch of pathetic little...[AN]
Forget it. I'm gonna take[N]
a look around myself, then.[AN]

[FarFarRight]
M-Miss Echidna! It's dangerous![AN]
That scream... they were being[N]
attacked for sure! No doubt![AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm not going to make[N]
any of you join me.[AN]
But need I remind you[N]
what we stand for?[AN]
I'm going to go see[N]
if I can help them.[AN]

[FarRight]
I'll join you then, Echidna.[AN]
Calvin, take some of the men[N]
and secure an escape route.[AN]

[Right]
Hehe, don't go dying on me, friend.[AN]
I'll have that escape route ready[N]
before you can blink twice![AN]
[Clear][FarRight][Clear][MidRight][LoadBarrelle]

[MidLeft]
Sorry for dragging you[N]
into this, Barrelle.[AN]

[MidRight]
I volunteered, so[N]
don't worry about it.[AN]
Maybe someone just[N]
slipped and fell, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, here's[N]
hoping...[A][2X][X]



#0x9DB Chapter9Opening2
[Right][LoadLizzy][FarRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadEchidna]
Sorry to disturb[N]
your sleep, guys.[AN]
Do you know[N]
what's going on?[AN]

[FarRight]
Yeah. You're sure[N]
the enemy is out there?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I was just looking outside.[AN]
Yet I didn't see a soul inside,[N]
and the torches weren't lit.[AN]
Seems almost deceptively safe,[N]
if you catch my drift.[AN]

[FarRight]
So, do you[N]
have a plan?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Of course.[AN]
That's why I came[N]
to find you guys.[AN]

[MidLeft][Clear][LoadBarrelle]
Haha, that's right.[AN]
On three, we all[N]
burst out of here.[AN]
One! Two! Three![A][2X][X]



#0x9DC Chapter9Opening3
[Left][LoadLizzy]
I don't see anyone...[N]
Is anybody here?[AN]
There's not much light[N]
so I can't see far...[AN]

[Right][LoadBarrelle]
Don't let your guard[N]
down, alright kid?[AN]
Anyways, we're looking[N]
for any victims here.[AN]
Maybe we should[N]
light the torches?[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadEchidna]
It's true that it's hard to see,[N]
but that'd also draw attention.[AN]
Let's keep them put out until[N]
we can be sure it's safe here.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadIsaac]
If the enemy is lurking about,[N]
we're in for a real treat...[AN]
Is this where you said you[N]
heard those screams, Echidna?[AN]

[Left]
Yeah, I think so.[AN]
If someone screamed[N]
loudly back here,[AN]
you'd be able to hear[N]
it from the meeting hall.[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadLizzy][Right][Clear][MidRight][LoadIsaac][Left]
[Beat][AN]
I think we should[N]
light the torches.[AN]
I don't think we can[N]
do this without seeing...[AN]
It's just too dark.[AN]
I'll just take[N]
this match and...[AN]
[Clear]
Huh?![AN]
[LoadLizzy]
Oww...[AN]

[MidRight]
Here, take my hand.[N]
I'll help you up.[AN]

[Left]
...Thank you, Isaac.[AN]
But, what the heck[N]
did I just trip over?[AN]
It didn't feel hard...[N]
Wait... what is...?![AN]
Is this a... person?![AN]

[Left][Clear][MidRight][Clear][MidRight][LoadLizzy][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
As I thought,[N]
they're dead.[AN]
Echidna, we'll[N]
have to stay sharp.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][LoadEchidna]
[Beat][AN]
I can't believe this...[N]
I'm sorry, friends...[AN]
We'll recover your[N]
bodies properly later.[AN]
You... you dastards!![AN]
Show yourselves, you[N]
cowards! God damnit!![AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Hehehe...[N]
Ah! How wonderful...[AN]
It seems that our[N]
information was right...[AN]
Oh, I'm such a lucky lady![AN]
I've been looking for[N]
you for so long, Captain,[AN]
and we finally meet again![AN]

[MidRight][Clear][MidLeft][Clear]
[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
...!![AN]
That voice...[N]
You're...[A][2X][X]



#0x1076 Chapter9CG
Hehehe...[N]
Is it truly you?[AN]
Captain Isaac?[AN]
I've been looking[N]
for you forever.[AN]
Oh... at last...[A][2X][X]



#0x9DD Chapter9Opening4
[MidLeft][LoadHaguro][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Haguro...[AN]
Is that really you?[N]
You're... alive...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, my Captain![N]
It's me, your Haguro![AN]
It's so nice to[N]
finally see you again...[AN]
Always, always I've[N]
been looking for you![AN][CloseEyes]
Ah... this is like[N]
a dream come true...[AN][OpenEyes]

[MidRight]
Haguro, tell me.[AN]
What happened to you[N]
in these last years?[AN]
Why... why are you[N]
wearing that insignia?[AN]
It's the Schwarzritter's...[AN]

[MidLeft]
My Captain... you[N]
remember, don't you?[AN]
The day they banished[N]
us from our country...[AN]

[MidRight]
...I'll never[N]
forget that day.[AN]

[MidLeft]
To escape the strike force,[N]
Sir Weitz, Sir Niekay,[AN]
and all the others...[AN]
They all risked their[N]
lives to act as decoys.[AN]

[MidRight]
And that's...[N]
where you were.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I was waek and pathetic.[AN]
But you had always helped me,[AN]
so I was so happy to finally[N]
be of some use to you...[AN]
And then, when I was[N]
surrounded by soldiers,[AN]
I thought I would die...[N]
I swung my sword desperately.[AN]
When I opened my eyes...[AN]
They were all dead, their[N]
blood pooling at my feet.[AN]
That's when I learned I[N]
had a talent for killing.[AN]
I was captured, but...[N]
I was saved by someone,[AN]
and assigned to this place.[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
The Schwarzritter are an[N]
Etrurian order of dark knights.[AN]
We're doing our best to do the...[N]
dirty jobs for our glorious Etruria.[AN]
It was our old unit after all...[N]
The Captain's unit, the Nameless...[AN]

[MidRight]
Haguro...[N]
Do you resent me?[AN]
I... I escaped before[N]
they could kill me.[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, that's not it at all![N]
I still like you, Captain.[AN]
But as an officer,[AN]
it's my duty to destroy the[N]
Resistance hideout here,[AN]
and defeat the Nameless.[AN]
Um, hey, Captain...[AN]
Can you just... allow me[N]
to capture you now...?[AN]
If you do that, I can[N]
help you, Captain![AN]

[MidRight]
You're only[N]
talking about me...[AN]
What about[N]
everyone else?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm sorry. I can't[N]
help them, because...[AN]
I... I just want you.[AN]
I want you to see[N]
me like I see you.[AN]
I just want to be[N]
with you forever...[AN]
I don't need anybody[N]
else, my Captain...[AN]

[MidRight]
I have my own[N]
goals to achieve.[AN]
So, Haguro...[AN]
I can't give in[N]
to you here.[AN]
We'll just have[N]
to fight it out.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hehehe...[AN]
Just what I'd[N]
expect of my Captain.[AN]
Then I'll just have[N]
to take you by force...[AN]
I'm... much stronger[N]
than I was back then.[AN]
I followed your[N]
teachings every day...[AN]
And I became the[N]
leader of this squad![AN]
I'll show you just[N]
how much I've grown![AN]
Are you ready, Captain?[A][2X][X]




#0x9D8 Chapter9Opening5
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadEchidna]
Isaac... that girl.[N]
Did you know her?[AN]

[MidLeft]
...She used to be my subordinate.[AN]
I used to train her back when she[N]
was just a rookie, and now...[AN]
She seems to have gotten stronger.[N]
She belongs to the Schwarzritter,[AN]
one of the most elite orders of[N]
knights in all of Etruria...[AN]
We'll have to be very careful.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, isn't that great.[N]
Agh, my arm is killing me...[AN]
Sorry you saw all of that.[AN]
She's gonna have to pay[N]
for all that she's done...[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Echidna! It's an emergency![AN]
They're coming in through[N]
our secret passageways![AN]

[MidLeft][Beat][N]
You should leave this to us.[AN]
I don't have time to explain,[AN]
but I think me and my group[N]
are the most suited for this.[AN]

[MidRight]
...Alright, I'll trust you.[N]
Here, this is for you, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
What...[N]
is this?[AN]

[MidRight]
A Master Seal.[AN]
Give it to your[N]
strongest ally.[AN]
We'll leave the[N]
rest to you.[AN]
Don't die out[N]
there, okay?[A][2X][X]



#0x9E5 Chapter9Ending
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadHaguro]
Heheh... I always[N]
knew you were strong...[AN]
It just makes me love[N]
you more and more...[AN]
Hey... Captain...[N]
Am I stronger now?[AN]
All my effort...[N]
did you notice it?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Your skills have[N]
improved in every way.[AN]
And you are a fine[N]
commander, as well.[AN]
It's just that...[AN]
I don't want to have to[N]
see you again like this.[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[FarFarRight]
Captain Haguro, Ma'am![AN]
We're all prepared[N]
to begin the retrat![AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, then[N]
begin withdrawing.[AN]

[FarFarRight]
Yes Ma'am![AN]

[MidRight]
Well, now that we've picked up[N]
our wounded, I'll leave it at that.[AN]
Our mission to strike a blow to[N]
the Resistance was accomplished.[AN]
But is that enough? Captain... No.[N]
...Isaac. I will never let you go.[AN]
I'm not going to give up here.[N]
We'll meet again soon, okay?[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
You lead the front lines to act as[N]
a decoy so your wounded could retreat.[AN]
...You've grown more than I thought.[A][2X][X]

This is...[AN]
It's my fault.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][CloseEyes]
...Don't cry, Haguro.[N]
It's not a deep wound.[AN]
It's just... the blood[N]
makes it look worse.[AN]

But... but...[AN]
You were just[N]
protecting me...[AN]
and then I...[N]
It's my fault...[AN]
I'm too weak and I...[AN]

You're still a junior,[AN]

you're not as strong as me.[AN]
You'll become strong...[N]
Nothing will end here.[AN]

nothing compared to...[AN]

that right, Haguro...?[AN]

[MidRight]
W-whaaa![N]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Don't cry, don't cry.[AN]
On the battlefield, an officer[N]
should be smiling and composed.[AN]
I taught you that, right?[N]
Come on, show me your smile.[AN]

You said that you were[N]
a former Etrurian knight,[AN]
right? You told me that?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, I did.[N]
What about it?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Our enemy... that girl.[N]
She called you something...[AN]
The Nameless.[AN]
I've never heard of a[N]
unit with that name before.[AN]
Who are you guys, exactly...?[AN]

[MidRight]
...Are you suspicious[N]
of me? Is that it?[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
No, that's not it![AN]
I've never heard of that unit[N]

More importantly,[N]
how is your health?[AN]

[FarRight]
Yeah! Are you[N]

Well, as of right now, the pain is dulled.[AN]
But maybe because of how long I've been[N]
asleep, my body feels very shakey...[AN]
I'm going to need more time to regain[N]
my balance if I want to walk anywhere.[AN]

We can help[N]

A pleasure to finally meet you.[N]
I'm glad you're doing alright.[AN]
My name is Isaac, and I'm the[N]

If my wisdom can be of any use to you,[N]
I sincerely hope that I can repay you.[AN]

[Right]
Yes, I[N]

opration is proceeding?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, Ma'am! We're starting with[N]
an attack on the central corridor.[AN]
After we divert their focus there,[AN]
we will launch a [Red]surprise attack[N]
from the left and right sides.[Red][AN]
A classic pincer maneuver.[AN]
Since their vision range is[N]
limited in the dark of night,[AN]
they will likely use torches.[AN]
We can take advantage of that and[N]
[Red]topple them [Red]to reduce their vision.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hehe, I think that's a good plan.[AN]
Speaking of, your position, the[N]
[Red]Tactician, [Red]is unlike any other.[AN]
Your mere presence alone is enough[N]
to bolster the morale of our troops.[AN]
Try to keep to the back line, okay?[AN]

[MidRight]
Thank you for your concern.[N]
Back to the operation...[AN]
We will use many reinforcements,[N]
especially towards the center.[AN]
We place confidence in our[N]
troops stamina and endurance,[AN]
but we expect quite a struggle.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You don't underestimate anyone,[N]
do you? That's smart of you.[AN]
My Captain is out there...[N]
I have faith he can handle it.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hm... in that case, perhaps[N]
we should divert more troops...[AN]

[MidLeft]
How do I think my Captain would react...[N]
Hehe... I'm starting to have some fun![AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
I think that should do.[N]
Please, proceed with that.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes Ma'am![AN]
If you'd[N]
excuse me.[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
For now, I'll stay back[N]
and watch my Captain...[AN]
I'll just [Red]kill anyone who[N]
comes too close to me.[Red][AN]
I can't wait for him...[AN]
Now, is that enough[N]
information for you?[AN]
I know you're listening[N]
in over there. Heehee![A][2X][X]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
I think I...[N]
Messed up...[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft][LoadHaguro]
Oh, wonderful![N]
I've finally got you![AN]
Everyone, please take[N]
care of the others![AN]
Now we can finally[N]
be together...[AN]
Are you ready, my Captain?[N]
Heehee...[AN]
