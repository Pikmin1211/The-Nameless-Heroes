Lots of horse-drawn carriages[N]

passed by here pretty quickly.[AN]

I'd bet they're carrying goods[N]

stolen from the nearby villages.[AN]

Sorry to say, but I can't join[N]

you. I prefer a peaceful life.[AN]

On that note, I don't want[N]

to be drawing attention here,[AN]

so could you please leave?[A][2X][X]
